# Property Management Secure App Design

## Project Summary
This project is a secure, scalable web application designed and deployed using AWS infrastructure. It focuses on implementing modern security practices, including authentication, password hashing, and TLS encryption for secure communication between the client and backend servers.

The application consists of two main components:

1. Frontend (Apache Server):

   - Serves an asynchronous HTML+JavaScript client.

   - Delivers client-side code over a secure connection using TLS.

   - Ensures data integrity and confidentiality during download.

2. Backend (Spring Framework):

   - Handles backend services with RESTful API endpoints.

   - Protects communication using TLS.

   - Implements secure login functionality with password hashing.

Both the frontend and backend are deployed on separate EC2 instances in AWS, ensuring a secure and scalable architecture.

### Key Features:

#### Security Features

- TLS Encryption:
   - Secure transmission of data using TLS certificates generated through Let’s Encrypt.
- Login Security:
   - Implements user authentication with passwords securely stored as hashes using BCrypt.
- Asynchronous Client:
   - The HTML+JavaScript client uses async techniques to optimize performance while maintaining secure communication.

#### Deployment

- AWS Infrastructure:
   - The frontend (Apache) and backend (Spring) are deployed on separate EC2 instances.
- Let’s Encrypt Certificates:
   - Certificates are generated and installed for both the frontend and backend to enable HTTPS.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need the following software installed on your local machine:

- **Java 17+**: The project is built using Java. 
- **Maven**: Used for dependency management.
- **IDE (optional)**: An Integrated Development Environment like IntelliJ IDEA can be used for development.

### Installing

Follow these steps to get the development environment running:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nat15005/Nat15005-AREP-SECURE-APP-DESIGN.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project folder:**
   ```bash
   cd Nat15005-AREP-SECURE-APP-DESIGN.git
   ```
3. **Build the project using Maven:**
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

### Running the Server

Once the project is built, you can start the server with the following command:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The server will start and listen on port `443`.

### Accessing the Application

Open your web browser and go to:

```
https://localhost:443/
```

You should see the main page of the application.

## System Architecture
The system is divided into three main components:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ed8fe25-f91d-486e-8aa8-42bf6efd93bb)


1. *Frontend(Apache)🌐*  

   - Hosts the HTML+JavaScript client.
   - Serves static files over HTTPS using Let’s Encrypt certificates.
   - Communicates with the backend via secure REST API calls.

2. *Backend (Spring)🛠️* 

   - Provides RESTful API endpoints for user authentication and CRUD operations.
   - Uses TLS to secure communication with the frontend.
   - Stores user passwords as hashes in the database.

3. *Database🗃️*  

   - MySQL is used to store property data. The database is accessed via JPA/Hibernate in the backend, ensuring seamless data persistence and retrieval.
     
4. *AWS EC2 Instances☁️* 

   - Frontend and backend are deployed on separate EC2 instances.
   - Security Groups are configured to restrict access to authorized traffic only.
  
### Interaction Flow 🔄
Frontend → Backend: HTTPS request for user authentication (login/register).

Backend → Database: Query to verify or store user credentials (hashed passwords).

Backend → Frontend: HTTPS response with authentication result (success/failure).

Frontend → Backend: HTTPS request for property data (CRUD operations).

Backend → Database: Query to retrieve or update property data.

Backend → Frontend: HTTPS response with property data or operation result.


## Class Design

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59ba31dc-41eb-45ae-94c2-64f3e9a52538)


The main classes in the system are:

### 🏠 Property (Model)
- Description: Represents a property entity in the system. This class is mapped to the properties table in the database using JPA annotations.

- Attributes:

   - id: The unique identifier for the property (auto-generated by the database).

   - address: The address of the property (required).

   - price: The price of the property (required).

   - size: The size of the property (e.g., in square meters, required).

   - description: A description of the property (optional).

- Functionality: This class is used to store and retrieve property data from the database.

### 🎛️ PropertyController (Controller)
- Description: This is the REST controller that handles HTTP requests for CRUD operations on properties. It exposes endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting properties, as well as searching and pagination.

- Key Endpoints:

   - GET /api/properties: Retrieves a paginated list of all properties.

   - GET /api/properties/search: Searches for properties based on filters (address, price, size) and returns paginated results.

   - GET /api/properties/{id}: Retrieves a single property by its ID.

   - POST /api/properties: Creates a new property.

   - PUT /api/properties/{id}: Updates an existing property.

   - DELETE /api/properties/{id}: Deletes a property by its ID.

- Functionality: Acts as the interface between the frontend and the backend, processing requests and returning appropriate responses.

### 🛠️ PropertyService (Service)

- Description: This class contains the business logic for managing properties. It interacts with the PropertyRepository to perform CRUD operations, pagination, and search functionality.

- Key Methods:

   - getAllProperties(int page, int size): Retrieves a paginated list of all properties.

   - searchProperties(String query, Double maxPrice, Double maxSize, int page, int size): Searches for properties based on filters and returns paginated results.

   - getPropertyById(Long id): Retrieves a property by its ID.

   - createProperty(Property property): Creates a new property.

   - updateProperty(Long id, Property propertyDetails): Updates an existing property.

   - deleteProperty(Long id): Deletes a property by its ID.

- Functionality: Handles the core logic for property management and ensures data consistency.

### 🗄️ PropertyRepository (Repository)

- Description: This interface extends JpaRepository and provides CRUD operations for the Property entity. It also includes a custom query method for searching properties based on filters.

- Key Method:

   - search(String query, Double maxPrice, Double maxSize, Pageable pageable): Searches for properties based on address, price, and size filters, and returns paginated results.

- Functionality: Acts as the data access layer, interacting directly with the database to perform CRUD operations and custom queries.
